**!IMPORTANT!**: Please READ the **WHOLE** ReadMe (`<name>_ReadMe.txt`) before you edit them.

**!IMPORTANT!:** the files with `<name>_export.svg` are **ONLY!** for exporting the final RE styled icon, because of individual changes which makes the creating of the final icon easier (and correct) (e.g. merged parts because of non intentional (visible) paths which will be imported "false").

Mostly the size of the vector files are 1000x1000px (but not every time...).

##### Edit and create the final RE styled icon
You need a vector editor like Inkscape (others are possible too) and GIMP and if you want to export as the final RE styled icon (this is not needed for every graphics)you need the re-icon fu-script from Unnamed.

##### Install the fu-script
1. Download the fu-script (https://github.com/red-eclipse/community/tree/master/Iceflower/graphics/gimpscript)
2. Copy it to the GIMP config directory
 - Windows: `C:\Users\<Your name>\.gimp-x.x\scripts\`
 - Linux: `/home/<Your name>/.gimp-x.x/scripts/*

##### Edit the vector files
1. Install a vector program you like to use
2. Read tutorials or learning by doing :D

##### Create the final RE styled icon
1. Import the `.svg` with your wanted size in GIMP (just open it with GIMP)
2. If its necessary use `Colours -> Colour to Alpha` and choose black (html notation: 000000) to get only a white image with a transparency background
3. Use `Filters -> Alpha to Logo`
4. !HINT! Sometimes there are `<name>_part1.svg` and `<name>_part2.svg` here you need **NOT** the `<name>.svg` only the partX data, make them both to RE-style and combine them after it. (more 3D effect)
    - part1 over part2 and so on
    - In the `<name>.svg` are both parts in one file.
5. Export as `.png`
