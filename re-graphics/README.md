#### Notes
Please read the included README files before modifying anything as they provide useful information about the nature and the usage of the files.

the files with *``name_export.svg``* are **ONLY!** for export because of individual changes which makes editing after it much harder but easier to make an RE style of them (e.g. merged parts because of non intentional (visible) paths which will be import then "false").

Most of the files in SVG format have a resolution matching a power of two, 1024 x 1024 is the minimum size for source material.

##### For editing and exporting you need
A Vector Programm like Inkscape (others are possible too) and GIMP and if you want them with RE style you need the re-icon fu-script from Unnamed (not everything needs RE style e.g. sky, notexture or others)

##### To install the fu-script do this:
1. Download the fu-script (link below)
2. Copy it to the GIMP config directory
 - Windows: *``C:\Users\<Your name>\.gimp-x.x\scripts\``*
 - Linux: *``/home/<Your name>/.gimp-x.x/srcipts/``*

##### To edit the vector data do this:
1. Install a vector programm you like to use
2. Read tutorials or learning by doing :D

##### To make a RE style icon do this:
1. Import the *``.svg``* with your wanted size in GIMP (just open it with GIMP)
2. If its necessary use *``Colours -> Colour to Alpha``* and choose black (html notation: 000000) to get only a white image with a transparency background
3. Use *``Filters -> Alpha to Logo``*
4. !HINT! Sometimes there are *``name_part1.svg``* and *``name_part2.svg``* here you need **NOT** the *``name.svg``* only the partX data, make them both to RE-style and combine them after it. (more 3D effect)
    (part1 then over it part2 and so on) Sometimes its possible that a part of the part need to cut and put over the other part (like in the AbstraktTeleporter). But be sure that all parts have the same size.
    In the *name.svg* are only both parts in one data.
5. Export as *``.png``*
